Legal Descriptions
==================
In the United States rual land is described according to what is rederred to as `Goverment or Rectangle Survey`, or less fequently the `Public Land Survey System` and is used in thirty of the most rural states.

#### How It Works
A series of base-marks have been established for all of the continental US.
> Lines running north to south are referred to as `meridians` and east to west are called `base-lines`. And as you will notice meridians converage as they go north this is becuase the earth in not flat but curved.

#### Reading the Discriptions
Starting from a baseline and a meridian line `Township Lines` and `Range Lines` lay out a grid of `six-mile` square blocks.

> For example, the first line six miles north of the Base Line is named Township 1 North of the  Base line and the first line six miles west of the Meridian is Range 1 West of the Principle Meridian.  The block that those two lines form is called Township 1 South, Range 1 East, or T1S,R1E.

+ Meridian  --> Range Lines    --> N to S
+ Base Line --> Township Lines --> E to W

__Sections__
Each Township and Range is further divided into `1-mile` squares called `Sections`. The most important thing to remember about this stage of the process is that the `36` sections are numbered and arranged BOTH left to right AND right to left. With one starting at the upper most right hand corrner.

Each section can be divided into quarters and halves. So that a quarter-section is 160 acres and a quarter of a quarter is 40 acres.

> In the figure above, the ten-acre square in the northwest corner is described as "The Northwest Quarter of the Northwest Quarter of the Northwest Quarter of Section 12 Township 29N, Range 8 West" which is abbreviated 
> NW1/4 NW1/4 NW1/4 S12 T29N R8W or simply NW NW NW 12-29-8.

#### Example

In this case, we want to locate the property on a topo map, so we find the correct map by township and range and we locate Section 16 in Township 29 North, Range 2 East.  A typical Section is one mile square and contains 640 acres.

Next, we find the center of the section by drawing diagonals from each corner. Then you locate the Southeast Quarter of Section.16  A typical Quarter Section is half a mile square and contains 160 acres.

Using the same technique, we locate the Southwest Quarter of the Southeast Quarter of Section 16.  A typical Quarter-Quarter Section is quarter mile square and contains 40 acres. 

> ![alt text](/imgs/NWSWSES16.jpg)

And finally, we locate the Northwest Quarter of the Southwest Quarter of the Southeast Quarter of Section 16, Township 29 North, Range 2 East. A typical Quarter-Quarter-Quarter Section is 660 feet square and contains 10 acres.
